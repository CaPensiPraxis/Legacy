# Legacy

Legacy is a curing system based around server side curing, with an array of intuitive predictive curing. The major goal with this system was to not only remove the burden of having to understand how to code for new players, it is powerful enough so that advance users can begin heavily modifying it to suit their playstyle.

# Features
- A full curing system that utilizes the server side function of curing.
- A UI integration through the EXTRAS function
- A Limb Tracker integration through the EXTRAS function
- A Basher integration through the EXTRAS function
- Trades function that includes Conuration, Inkmilling, and Augmentation (More to come!)
- In-game soundtrack which changes with each you are in, and gives ambient background music.
